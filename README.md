Color Detection from Images – Overview

Color detection is used to identify specific colors in digital images.

It’s widely used in computer vision and automation tasks.

The process begins with reading an image using OpenCV.

Images are usually converted from BGR to HSV color space.

HSV is preferred because it separates color from brightness.

Users define a lower and upper HSV range for the target color.

A mask is created to isolate the color within that range.

The mask is applied to the original image using bitwise operations.

This highlights only the desired color region.

Trackbars can be added to adjust color range dynamically.

It helps in real-time color selection without hardcoding values.

NumPy is used for array processing and masking.

Applications include object tracking and visual inspection.

It’s useful in robotics, agriculture, and medical imaging.

Color detection works on both images and live video.

It can detect multiple colors by stacking multiple masks.

Accuracy depends on lighting and image quality.

Preprocessing like blurring or filtering may help.

It's simple to implement with Python and OpenCV.

A great project to learn the basics of image processing.
